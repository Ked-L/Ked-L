- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Kedrick! I love coding and enjoy building many projects and skills in my spare time. I'm currently
learning Python, API, OOP, JSON and much more!
I'm looking forward to present my ideas and experience to various companies Google, Verizon, Riot Games, and
I aspire to work with others with similar ideas and goals as me so feel free to reach out anytime!
You may reach me @Kedricklevy21@gmail.com at any time

Thanks for tuning in, peace!
